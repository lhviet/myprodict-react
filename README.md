## Structure
1. Components - [ARc](https://arc.js.org/) Atomic design
- `atoms` contains very basic (principle) components
- `molecules` contains components comprising from `atoms`
- `organisms` contains components comprising from `atoms`, `molecules`, and `organisms`  

**`Components` contains no-container-components only, there are no containers mapped to `components`.**
Any component which requires logic & data will be located in `containers`.

2. Containers  
Components in `containers` including both UI & its logic  
- `atoms`, `molecules`, and `organisms` are same with `components`
- `pages` contains pages in routes
